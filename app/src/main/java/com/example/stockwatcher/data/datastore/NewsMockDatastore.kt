Over the past several weeks, Delta engaged extensively with state elected officials in both parties to express our strong view that Georgia must have a fair and secure election process, with broad voter participation and equal access to the polls. The legislation signed this week improved considerably during the legislative process, and expands weekend voting, codifies Sunday voting and protects a voter’s ability to cast an absentee ballot without providing a reason. For the first time, drop boxes have also been authorized for all counties statewide and poll workers will be allowed to work across county lines. Nonetheless, we understand concerns remain over other provisions in the legislation, and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort. We are committed to continuing to listen to our people and our communities, and engage with leaders from both parties to ensure every eligible employee and Georgia voter can exercise their right to vote."))

The two Ecuadorian girls—sisters aged three and five—were dropped from the border barrier west of Mt. Cristo Rey, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In the video, two men on the Mexico side can be seen running away, leaving the children alone in the desert. The scene was caught on camera by a Border Patrol agent who then rescued the girls and took them to a hospital where they were medically cleared. “I’m appalled by the way these smugglers viciously dropped innocent children from a 14-foot border barrier last night,” El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez said. “If not for the vigilance of our agents using mobile technology, these two tender-aged siblings would have been exposed to the harsh elements of desert environment for hours.” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said: “The inhumane way smugglers abuse children while profiting off parents’ desperation is criminal and morally reprehensible.”"))
